I am a **Principal Research Scientist** at Huawei Canada, leading a research team focused on **AI-native software development** and **intelligent vulnerability management**. My team develops cutting-edge AI agent systems for automated software engineering, including the **Lingxi Agent framework**, which achieved **#2 globally on SWE-bench Verified** with a **74.6% resolution rate** and **#1 among open-source models**.

I work closely with engineering teams to productionize AI agents for **long-horizon software engineering tasks**, including **cross-file bug fixing**, **repository-level issue resolution**, and **end-to-end feature development**, with **70-90% measured efficiency gains** across multiple product lines.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [SAIL (Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab)](https://sailresearch.github.io/sail-website), Queen's University, Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Ahmed E. Hassan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hwXx34AAAAJ) and [Prof. Shaowei Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/mambalab). My dissertation explored extrinsic incentives in open source communities through mining GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Bountysource data.

**Research Interests:** AI agents for software engineering, LLM-based code generation, multi-agent collaboration, intelligent vulnerability management, mining software repositories.

**Publications:** My work has appeared in premier software engineering venues including **ICSE**, **ASE**, **FSE**, **IEEE TSE**, and **EMSE**. ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=ySQkd5nCb0cC)).

**Industry Experience:** Prior to Huawei, I was a Senior Software Engineer at **Alibaba Group**, where I served as the **founding engineer** of 1688's **One-Click Dropshipping (一件代发/一键代销)** system—a **full-stack, end-to-end platform** connecting B2B suppliers with millions of Taobao/Tmall merchants for automated order fulfillment and inventory-free retail operations. 



I hold **10+ patents** in software engineering and AI applications.
