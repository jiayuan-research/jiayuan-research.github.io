Hi, I am Jiayuan Zhou, a principal researcher with Huawei Canada (Waterloo Research Center). My team and I currently focus on how to leverage LLM to assist practical OSS vulnerability management (e.g., OSS vulnerabilities early sensing, validation, explanation, evaluation, and patching).

I received my Ph.D. degree at Software Analysis and Intelligence (SAIL) Lab, Queenâ€™s University, under the supervision of professor Ahmed E. Hassan and professor Shaowei Wang. My thesis is about studying the extrinsic rewards in open source software communities. For example, how to leverage bounties (i.e., the monetary incentive) to address GitHub issue reports, and what is the impact of bounty in Stack Overflow. And my thesis is about mining data from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Bountysource.

As a researcher, my research interests include intelligent vulnerability management, mining software repositories, extrinsic incentives in crowdsourced software engineering. 
My work has been published in premier software engineering venues (e.g.,ICSE, ASE, FSE, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, and Empirical Software Engineering). More information at:
[google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=ySQkd5nCb0cC).

I also spent two years working as a senior software developer in Alibaba Group and published three patents.
