Hi, I am Jiayuan Zhou, a principal researcher with Huawei Canada (Waterloo Research Center). I lead a research team to conduct and apply cutting-edge techniques to design and implement research protocols for improving supply chain security in open source. I also collaborate closely with global researchers and product teams to help them improve OSS asset management/OSS supply chain security and integrate our solutions into the product.


I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Software Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL Lab), Queenâ€™s University, Canada under the supervision of professor Ahmed E. Hassan and professor Shaowei Wang. My thesis is about studying the extrinsic rewards in open source software communities. For example, how to leverage bounties (i.e., the monetary incentive) to address GitHub issue reports, and what is the impact of bounty in Stack Overflow. And my thesis is about mining data from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Bountysource.

As a researcher, my research interests include intelligent vulnerability management, mining software repositories, extrinsic incentives in crowdsourced software engineering. 
My work has been published in premier software engineering venues (e.g.,ICSE, ASE, FSE, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, and Empirical Software Engineering). More information at:
[google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=ySQkd5nCb0cC).

I also spent two years working as a senior software developer in Alibaba Group and published three patents.
